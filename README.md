Recently, deep ConvNets have significantly improved image classification and object detection accuracy. Compared to image classification, object detection is a more challenging task that requires more complex methods to solve. Solutions to these problems often compromise speed, accuracy, or simplicity. Fast RCNN and Faster RCNN, which address these issues and further enhance the speed and efficiency of the object detection process.
